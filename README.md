# SLACK <-> JENKINS BOT

[![License](http://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/bsramin/slack-jenkins-bot/blob/main/LICENSE.txt)

This bot allows you to safely and _effectively_ run jobs on jenkins _directly from Slack_, also receiving end-of-execution notifications.
Through permissions it is possible to configure, for each single job, who has the right to execute it from slack and at any time it is possible to check the last jobs performed.

## USAGE

After the [installation](documentation/install.md), from Slack simply run the commands.

Eg.

  `/do job1`

  `/do job2 param1=value1`

  `/do job3 param1=value1 param2=value2`

  `/requests` (the view the latest requests)

### Jenkins Response

If your `request` needs to show on slack an output generated by the Jenkins job, you just have to generate an [artifact](documentation/slackResponse.txt) which contains this output.
Use this snippet:

```groovy
slackfields = '"title1","content1","false"\n"title2","content2","false"'
writeFile(file: 'slackResponse.txt', text: slackfields)
archiveArtifacts artifacts: 'slackResponse.txt', onlyIfSuccessful: true
```

The last element of `slackfields` (boolean) identifies the full-width (true) or half-width (false) block on slack in order to stack two of them

## SETUP

Follow the [setup instruction](documentation/install.md)

## FAQ

### How do I access Jenkins server from behind a router?

You can use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) or [webhookrelay](https://webhookrelay.com/)
