# SLACK <-> JENKINS BOT

This bot allows you to safely and _effectively_ run jobs on jenkins _directly from Slack_, also receiving end-of-execution notifications.
Through permissions it is possible to configure, for each single job, who has the right to execute it from slack and at any time it is possible to check the last jobs performed.

## USAGE

After the [installation](documentation/install.md), from Slack simply run the commands.

Eg.

  `/do job1`

  `/do job2 param1=value1`

  `/do job3 param1=value1 param2=value2`

  `/requests` (the view the latest requests)

## SETUP

Follow the [setup instruction](documentation/install.md)
